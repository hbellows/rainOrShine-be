Sweater Weather Project Spec
1. Weather for a City
The functionality for this page should be split into multiple user stories.

GET /api/v1/forecast?location=denver,co
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Response:

There is room for personal preference for this response body. Use the mock ups to see what data is required on the front end to decide what you would like to include in your response. If you’d like more of a challenge, you might consider using Fast JSON API and consider trying to stick to the JSON 1.0 spec.

Requirements:

Needs to pull out the city and state from the GET request and send it to Google’s Geocoding API to retrieve the lat and long for the city (this can be it’s own story)
Retrieve forecast data from the Darksky API using the lat and long
Root Page

2. Retrieve Background Image Based on Location
GET /api/v1/backgrounds?location=denver,co
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Response:

Room for personal preference on how you structure this response.

Requirements:

Returns a random image from a collection of images.
The collection of images must be limited to the city being viewed.
Must use an external API to retrieve these images.
Possibilities:

Use Flickr:
search
Returns a collection of photos for a location.
Feel free to tweak this call but this is a good base: lat, lon, api_key, method, format, nojsoncallback, and extras=url_o
photos.getInfo
Probably not necessary to hit this endpoint but wanted to include it in case you needed more info for a specific photo. Check out the documentation for extras in the API call above.
Stretch goal:
Write a rake task that caches photos for the 50 largest U.S. cities to improve page load times (this should be a separate user story)
