Sweater Weather Project
1. Weather for a City
The functionality for this page should be split into multiple user stories.
```
GET /api/v1/forecast?location=denver,co
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```
Response:

There is room for personal preference for this response body. Use the mock ups to see what data is required on the front end to decide what you would like to include in your response. If you’d like more of a challenge, you might consider using Fast JSON API and consider trying to stick to the JSON 1.0 spec.

Requirements:

  - Needs to pull out the city and state from the GET request and send it to Google’s Geocoding API to retrieve the lat and long for the city (this can be it’s own story)
  - Retrieve forecast data from the Darksky API using the lat and long
